           <p>Hello! This is my first stab at the IT world, I never thought I would really enjoy the process of web development. But its actually turning out to be pretty fun, and helping build soft skills towards my coding experience. I'm spending my off time with my wife and the fur babies or involed in some sort of workout.</p>
